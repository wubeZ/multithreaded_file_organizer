# Multithreaded File Organizer

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7%2B-blue)

A multithreaded CLI tool to organize files efficiently by type, date, or size. This tool is perfect for decluttering directories and automating file management tasks.

---

## Features
- **Organize by File Type**: Group files into folders based on their extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`).
- **Organize by Date**: Sort files into folders by their creation or modification date.
- **Organize by Size**: Categorize files into small, medium, and large based on size thresholds.
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview changes without making actual modifications.
- **Multithreaded Processing**: Uses threads to handle file organization faster, especially in large directories.
- **Custom Logging**: Logs all actions to the console or a specified file.

## Installation

### Using `pip`:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multithreaded-file-organizer.git
   cd multithreaded-file-organizer
   ```
2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Command
```bash
organize --path <directory_path> --by <method>
```

### Options
- `--path`: Path to the directory to organize (required).
- `--by`: Organization method. Choose from:
  - `type`: Organize by file type.
  - `date`: Organize by creation/modification date.
  - `size`: Organize by file size.
- `--dry-run`: Simulate changes without making any modifications.
- `--log`: Log actions to a specified file.
- `--recursive`: Organize files in subdirectories as well.

### Examples

1. Organize by file type:
   ```bash
   organize --path ./Downloads --by type
   ```

2. Organize by date with dry-run mode:
   ```bash
   organize --path ./Documents --by date --dry-run
   ```

3. Organize by size and log actions to a file:
   ```bash
   organize --path ./Projects --by size --log organize.log
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Categorization**: The tool scans the directory and groups files based on the selected method (type, date, or size).
2. **Multithreading**: Tasks are distributed across multiple threads to optimize performance.
3. **Action Execution**: Moves files to their respective folders. If `--dry-run` is enabled, no changes are made.
4. **Logging**: Logs each action to the console or a file for review.
